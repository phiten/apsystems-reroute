"""Print the MQTT credentials an EZHI inverter presents, so your broker can let it in.

Local MQTT needs the broker to accept the inverter, and the inverter
authenticates with a password held in firmware: 25 characters, printed nowhere
on the device and not derivable from anything you can read off it. Mosquitto
will not tell you what it is either -- a rejected client is logged by name,
never by password. So it has to be read off the wire once, and this is the
thing that reads it.

It stands in for the broker exactly long enough for the inverter to say hello:
it answers on the broker's port with the broker's certificate, reads the MQTT
CONNECT, prints what was in it, and exits. Nothing is stored and nothing is
forwarded. The inverter's attempt simply fails, it retries about every ten
seconds, and it is none the wiser.

    ./ezhi_mqtt_credentials.py listen --cert ezhi_broker.crt --key ezhi_broker.key

Run it where the inverter's traffic already lands, with nothing else holding port
9005. With a DNS rewrite that is any machine you point the name at. With a static
route it is the machine the route points at and no other -- the rule rewrites the
destination and not the source, so a third machine would answer under its own
address and the inverter would drop the reply. Then put what it prints into your
broker's logins and send the redirect back.

Inside this add-on none of that placement is your problem: capture_credentials
in the options points the DNAT rules here instead of at your broker, on this
same host, so nothing has to be moved and the broker does not even have to stop.

This file is a copy of tools/ezhi_mqtt_credentials.py in the integration
repository (phiten/EZHI), which is where it is maintained -- people who do
not run this add-on need it too. Keep the two in step; the selftest below is the
same one and runs in tests/run_tests.sh.

Needs: nothing outside the standard library.  Self-check: capture_credentials.py selftest
